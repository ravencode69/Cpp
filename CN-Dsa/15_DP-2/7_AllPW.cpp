Given two integers a and b. You need to find and return the count of possible ways
in which we can represent the number a as the sum of unique integers raise to the power b.
For example: if a = 10 and b = 2, only way to represent 10 as sum of unique integers raised to power 2 is-*/
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int getAllWays(int a, int b)
{
    // Write your code here
